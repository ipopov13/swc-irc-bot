ended_supplies:-      Unfortunately your group's supplies have reached a critical level
ended_supplies:-  and you are forced to turn back. You should prepare better next time!

ended_injury:-      A member of the group has beed injured badly and cannot continue the
ended_injury:-  trip! The guide calls a rescue craft that takes you off the planet.

organized_game:-      You have successfuly hunted your selected game! You spend the night
organized_game:-  resting and head to the extraction point the next morning.

random_game:-      You have successfuly hunted your selected game! You can now relax and
random_game:-  have fun for the rest of the trip, or simply help the other group members
random_game:-  do the same.

Ithor_arrival:-      The sight of the bright green and blue streaks of jungles and rivers
Ithor_arrival:-  below are by themselves something worth the trouble of getting a visa.
Ithor_arrival:-  The fact that you are going to go down and see the lush forests up close
Ithor_arrival:-  is the result of an extremely "lucky call" on behalf of the GSC.
Ithor_arrival:-      As you pass the customs checks and smile at the Ithorian guards you
Ithor_arrival:-  pass in corridors of the floating city you begin to feel a certain tension
Ithor_arrival:-  in the posture of the company guide. After rounding the last corner you
Ithor_arrival:-  are suddenly pushed into a niche in the wall by the guide. It turns out to
Ithor_arrival:-  be a small docking bay with space for a single shuttle. The craft is almost
Ithor_arrival:-  full with jumpy looking tourists with odd shaped bags. Just like the one
Ithor_arrival:-  you are carrying...

Ithor_start:-      Finally the shuttle is full and the pilot closes the hatch and releases
Ithor_start:-  the clamps. The vessel dives sharply, plunging into the low clowds. The
Ithor_start:-  vast jungles of Ithor await you!

Ithor_event_patrol@h:-      You are pushing through the undergrowth when suddenly a siren starts
Ithor_event_patrol@h:-  somewhere close nearby. The guide gives you the signal to "hide-without-
Ithor_event_patrol@h:-  objection". On Ithor this can mean only one thing - a poacher patrol is
Ithor_event_patrol@h:-  nearby! The only thing you can do is hide and use any countermeasure at
Ithor_event_patrol@h:-  your disposal, as being caught hunting in this jungle means a lifetime
Ithor_event_patrol@h:-  ban from the planet and all of its flying cities, not to mention the
Ithor_event_patrol@h:-  chance of being shot on sight!

Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-      Some time after dawn you break down your camp and head on towards
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  the next waypoint of the trip. You take care not to leave anything
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  behind - there are patrols scanning the plains and jungles of Ithor
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  for poachers at all times. As the campsite disappears behind you, you
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  start feeling a low vibration in the ground beneath your feet. A minute
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  later the whole group stops and tries to determine the source of the
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  tremors that are now starting to show as a noise too, and making plants
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  around you wobble.
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-      Suddenly a large machine appears between the trees on the next ridge,
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  ladden with packs, dead animals and armed sentients. They do not bear
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  any markings, but you need none - they are poachers. You'll have to
Ithor_event_poachers@fh:-  either destroy them or hide and hope they do not notice you!

Ithor_event_stampede@s:-      Some time after dawn you break down your camp and head on towards
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  the next waypoint of the trip. You take care not to leave anything
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  behind - there are patrols scanning the plains and jungles of Ithor
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  for poachers at all times. As the campsite disappears behind you, you
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  start feeling a low vibration in the ground beneath your feet. A minute
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  later the whole group stops and tries to determine the source of the
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  tremors that are now starting to show as a noise too, and making plants
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  around you wobble.
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-      Suddenly animals start appearing all around you, bodies of shape,
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  size, and colour that you never dreamed of, streaming and bumping into
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  one another as they push forward. They are all headed in a single
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  direction and their sheer volume drowns your group in seconds, scattering
Ithor_event_stampede@s:-  you around. You have to find cover or another way to survive this stampede!

help1:-  Welcome to the office of the GSC! Please read carefully the following
help1:-  information pertaining to the use of our services.
help1:-
help1:-  COMMANDS
help1:-   To select equipment: !weapons, !tools, !suits
help1:-   To check your hunting ticket status: !status
help1:-   To select a hunting destination: !destination, !game
help1:-   TO start an already paid trip: `!start start_code`
help1:-
help1:-      Please note these are the commands available when no hunting trip
help1:-  is under way. When you arrive at your selected destination you should
help1:-  consult the local information directory for further instructions!
help1:-
help1:-  STARTING A HUNTING TRIP
help1:-      If you are new you should try our free tours that are clearly
help1:-  marked in the !game list for each destination!
help1:-      Once you have selected both a planet and a creature with the
help1:-  !destination and !game commands you can check the different prices
help1:-  for the trip with the !status command. There are three types of
help1:-  hunting trips:
help1:-      1) A single ticket to the planet with a random group (group size
help1:-  is based on how dangerous the planet is). You may or may not encounter
help1:-  the specific creature you are hunting during the trip, depending on
help1:-  how rare the creature is. No experience is awarded if the creature is
help1:-  not encountered and successfuly defeated/captured!
help1:-      2) An organized group with a maximum size based on the planet and
help1:-  specific creature you selected. You select the actual group size.
help1:-      3) Organized groups with GSC back-up. Same as the above, except
help1:-  that the group will be complemented by Company hunters, guides or
help1:-  trackers up to the requested size in the case of forced departure
help1:-  (see below).
help1:-      Send the funds to Iven Trall along with a DM clearly stating the
help1:-  trip you'd like to purchase and the size of your hunting party if
help1:-  organized. 
help1:-      Once you pay the cost you will receive a code for the trip, which
help1:-  you have to enter with the `!start code` command. Hunters registering
help1:-  an organized group will also receive a second code, which they can use
help1:-  to force the start of the trip in case some of the party members can't
help1:-  make it, using the `!force force_code` command.
help1:-      RANDOM groups will start once the group size for the planet has
help1:-  been filled or 24 hours after the first hunter registration, whichever
help1:-  comes first. In the later case the group is filled with company
help1:-  hunters, trackers or guides up to the recommended size for the planet.
help1:-      ORGANIZED groups will start once the chosen number of hunters have
help1:-  entered the code or the force code is used. Forced groups will NOT
help1:-  be complemented with GSC guides and/or trackers if the GSC back-up
help1:-  option was not selected!
help1:-
help1:-  EXPERIENCE AND INJURY
help1:-      Your hunting experience is increased with each unique
help1:-  destination/creature combination you select and complete successfuly.
help1:-  Experience gives you a percentage chance to perform better at any
help1:-  task, letting you survive longer and take down more dangerous
help1:-  creatures.
help1:-      You can sometimes be injured in your travels. Your teammates can
help1:-  try to help you, and you can also rest during less dangerous parts of
help1:-  the trip, but if you do not heal and are injured a second time the
help1:-  trip is over for the whole group and you will not be able to join
help1:-  another trip for 24 hours!
