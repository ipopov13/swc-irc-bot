## TO DO: code and trip commands!
Set dest and game to 0 after trip end!
When a party is formed (hunter uses a code) the party stats are calculated for every check so updates can be made without problems.
Add preset GSC hunters, trackers and guides with standardized equipment and add them to random or organized+ groups based on group stats!
Manage a list of online hunters to send party messages to.
